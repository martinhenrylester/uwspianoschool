team-description: <p>At Upper West Side Piano School we offer one-on-one piano lessons to students of all ages and levels. Whether you are introducing your child to the world of music, fulfilling your own dreams of learning piano, preparing for college auditions, or anything in between, we structure our lessons to meet our student’s individual goals. Lessons at UWS Piano School concentrate on the development of rhythm and note literacy, along with knowledge of music theory and history, to provide the foundation necessary for all musical pursuits. We strive to instill efficient practice habits and technical skills at the keyboard, enabling our students to confidently explore any genre of music they wish.</p><p>Helping pianists discover and develop their talents in an honest and encouraging manner is very important to us. We find that a fun and supportive atmosphere filled with clear, positive communication allows students to achieve the best of their individual ability.</p><p>Recitals are free of charge and are held in the sanctuary at Grace and St. Paul’s, with a reception to follow. They provide a comfortable atmosphere for our students to share the fruits of their hard work with friends and family. While participation is not mandatory, we encourage all students to take part in performing.  Regular public performance is helpful in developing self-confidence and appreciation for the work of others.</p><p>Receptions follow our Winter and Spring Children’s Recitals where students have a chance to meet one another and make new friends. For our adult students, we organize cheese and wine soirées for you to perform in a casual setting.</p>Additional performing opportunities are available.</p>
