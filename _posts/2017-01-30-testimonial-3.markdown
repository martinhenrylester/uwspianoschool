parent-name: Muzna
student-name: Zara & Ayla
student-age: 9 & 7
testimonial: Nadia taught our girls piano over the course of eighteen months. My girls looked forward to their lessons and strove to impress her. She made sure they learned the basics well but challenged them on a regular basis with harder pieces. Her cheerful personality and ability to connect with kids made it so much easier to keep them engaged. We were saddened by her move from the area but knew that she will do well anywhere as a piano teacher.
