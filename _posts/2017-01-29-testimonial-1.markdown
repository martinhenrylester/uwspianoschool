testimonial: Nadia was my daughter's first piano teacher (and we would have stayed with her had she not moved away). She was terrific with my daughter - helping to instill a love of music and, always important in the earlier ages, making her lessons fun. My daughter also told me how funny Miss Nadia is! My daughter progressed very quickly and I was quite surprised at how much progress she made in such a short time. I highly recommend Nadia - she is a teacher who helps build discipline but also ensures that piano never becomes a "chore." She's a wonderful teacher - and what a thrill it was to see her perform her dissertation piece!
