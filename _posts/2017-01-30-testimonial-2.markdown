testimonial: Nadia is so encouraging, patient and joyful to lean from. One of my favorite things about Nadia is that she will help you achieve your best with every piece of music both technically and emotionally, she never let me get away with shortcuts or mistakes. The best part is that she does this patiently and full of encouragement! She would always pick music pieces that I like to make the practice fun. I always felt happy, encouraged in our lessons. I studied with Nadia for over a year and we have accomplished so much! Nadia is an amazing piano teacher and I highly recommend her to anyone seeking enjoyable and greater achievement in piano studies.
